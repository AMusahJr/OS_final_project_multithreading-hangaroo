Hangaroo Game

Hangaroo is a simple word guessing game implemented in C. Players are tasked with guessing letters to reveal a hidden word. The game provides multiple difficulty levels and keeps track of the player's remaining lives.

Features

- There are three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
- The game uses a random selection of words based on the chosen difficulty level.
- The game requires user input for guessing letters.
- The game gives feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.
- The program gives a visual display of the current word and remaining lives.


Execution

1. To compile the code, use a C compiler to compile the source code into an executable binary. 
   gcc -o hangaroo hangaroo.c -pthread

2. Next, run the executable. Execute the compiled binary to start the game.
   ./hangaroo
   

3. Make sure to read the instructions and follow them carefully. Choose a difficulty level when prompted and input your guesses when prompted to guess a letter.

4. To play the Game, guess letters to reveal the hidden word. The game will provide feedback on your guesses and display the current word state and remaining lives.

5.  The game ends when the word is fully revealed or when the player runs out of lives.



Local Server

To host the Hangaroo game on a local server:

1. Compile the code and run the executable on your machine.
2. You can access the game by running the executable on your machine and interacting with it through the terminal.



Tests
1. The program should prompt the user with an invalid input alert when a letter or a number greater than 3 is entered when asked about the difficulty level.
2. The program should alert the user with an invalid input signal when the user enters a number instead of a letter.
3. The program should prevent the user from entering a correct letter or an incorrect letter twice.
